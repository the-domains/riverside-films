COLLIDING DREAMS recounts the dramatic history of one of the most controversial, and urgently relevant political ideologies of the modern era.

The century-old conflict in the Middle East continues to play a central role in world politics.

COLLIDING DREAMS addresses that void with a gripping exploration of Zionism's meaning, history and future.
